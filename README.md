# AgentMotus Design System

Portable design system docs for AgentMotus projects. Copy these into your repo or reference them when building UI.

## Contents

| File | Source project | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| [DESIGN_SYSTEM-Psychat.md](./DESIGN_SYSTEM-Psychat.md) | PolkaPsychat / PsyChat | Holographic, terminal-style UI — tokens, animations, glass, HoloPanel/HoloButton, Tailwind. |
| [DESIGN_SYSTEM-HUB.md](./DESIGN_SYSTEM-HUB.md) | MotusDAO Hub | Light / dark / Matrix themes, glassmorphism, gradient buttons, Matrix color variants. |

## Usage

1. Copy the relevant `.md` into your project (e.g. `docs/`).
2. Apply tokens, Tailwind config, and CSS from the doc.
3. Reuse or adapt component patterns (buttons, panels, typography) as needed.

## Propagation

Each doc includes a **Propagation checklist** at the end for adopting the system in a new codebase.
